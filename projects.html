                      <p>Understanding material behavior at high strain rates is important in the defense industry, here is an example
                      of a solid copper projectile impacting an aluminum plate. Due to strain rates and time scales, explicit dynamic analysis is necessary.</p>
                       <p> The red dots in this video show material failure; and so throughout the sequence, failed elements become red nodes. These two sequences
                       show material strain and stress in the z direction. The intent was to show stress wave propogation because in high-G environments
                           this is often where components fail, not due to the peak-g but the cyclical stress waves afterwards. If you look closely, you can see
                       the compressive and tensile stress waves in the second sequence. </p>

                      <p>Much of my work and hobbies have something to do with making 3-D parts or materials so this quick example is showcasing the
                      use of a COTS open source mobile application to scan components and turn them into .stl files, which are usable in the 3-d printing arena.
                      File format did not allow for .stl editing in SolidWorks.</p>

                      <p>I cannot be a true DIYer without building my very own 3-D printer. This video is on its side, but I chose to build a delta style printer rather than the typical
                      cartesian style printer. This creates a more aesthetic print process, which is what I was going for anyway. The beauty of machines at work.</p>
                      <p>At the point of this video, the printer was having homing issues, this explains the hot end trying to extrude in open space. This is also
                      the reason no heat bed or filliment is attached.</p>

                      <p>In most cases I would track this projectile to the sub-pixel resolution leading to rather high fidelity acceleration profiles,
                      but this is a sample video taken at 150,000fps...yes that means this test slug is moving at around 500ft/s and stops within a few inches. Welcome to the
                      world of ballistic and high-G engineering. I purchased this video camera for the inviting price of $200,000.00. The lighting in this video is lacking and
                      that is why it is a sample video and nothing more.</p>
