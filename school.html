                <p> I went to the University of Maryland for undergrad and have thus far continued in grad school. My experiences before returning to college have allowed me to take
                school more seriously than most college students. Engineering school was so fascinating to me
                that I took each and every project further than the original project domain. I would like to show a few images of random projects I took on in undergrad that went beyond the norm
                for most students. These include Wii-Nunchuck controlled RC cars, robotic hands, PCB failure mechanisms, home security systems and ballistic FE simulations.

                <p> Wyotech is where I was able to refine some of my metal fabrication and refinishing skills, even finishing second at the
                end of the year air-brushing competition. This is also where I was able to gain new sheetmetal fabrication skills. What I learned at Wyotech has
                helped in the engineering world by allowing me to acknowledging the possible while creating my mechanical designs. </p>
